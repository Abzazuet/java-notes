# Loop Control

- They allow us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the languages.

## While

- Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true.
- It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

```Java
while(Boolean_expression) {
   // Statements
}
```

```Java
public class Test {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int x = 10;
      while( x < 20 ) {
         System.out.print("value of x : " + x );
         x++;
         System.out.print("\n");
      }
   }
}
```
## For

- Execite a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

```Java
for(initialization; Boolean_expression; update) {
   // Statements
}
```
```Java
public class Test {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      for(int x = 10; x < 20; x = x + 1) {
         System.out.print("value of x : " + x );
         System.out.print("\n");
      }
   }
}
```
## do...while

- Like while, but it tests the condition at the end of the loop body
```Java
do {
   // Statements
}while(Boolean_expression);
```
```Java
public class Test {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int x = 10;
      do {
         System.out.print("value of x : " + x );
         x++;
         System.out.print("\n");
      }while( x < 20 );
   }
}
```
## Control statements

- They change execution from its normal sequence.
- When exectution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

### break

- Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers-execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.

### continue

- Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.

## Enhanced for loop
- `for (declaration : expression) {//statements}`.
- Declaration: the variable will be available within the for block and its value would be the sa,e as the current array element.
- Expression: this evaluates to the array you need to loop through. The expression can be array variable or method call that returns an array.

```Java
public class Test {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int [] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

      for(int x : numbers ) {
         System.out.print( x );
         System.out.print(",");
      }
      System.out.print("\n");
      String [] names = {"James", "Larry", "Tom", "Lacy"};

      for( String name : names ) {
         System.out.print( name );
         System.out.print(",");
      }
   }
}
```
