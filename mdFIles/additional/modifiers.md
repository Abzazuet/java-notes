# Modifiers
* They are keywords that you add to those definitions to change their meanings.
* To use a modifier, you include its keyword in the definition of the class, method or variable
## Access Control Modifiers
* Java provides a number of access modifiers to set acces levels for classes, variables, methods and constructors. The four access levels are:

    1. Visible to the package, the default. No modifiers are needed.
    2. Private: visible to the class only.
    3. Public: visible to the world.
    4. Protected: visible to the package and subclasses.
## Non-Access Modifiers
* Java provides this ones to achieve other functonalities:

    1. Static: to create class methods and variables.
    2. Final: for finilizing the implementations of classes, methods, and variables.
    3. Abstract: for creating abstract classes and methods.
    4. Synchonized and volatile modifiers: used for threads.
