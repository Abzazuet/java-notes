# LinkedList
- Same methods as an ArrayList since they implement the same List interface
- Stores items in containers.
- Has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list.
- To add an element to the list, the elements is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.
