# Basic Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

- This are used in mathematical expressions in the samy way they are used in algebra.

  1. Addition (+): adds values on either side of the operator.
  2. Substraction (-): substracts right-hand operand from the left-hand operand.
  3. Multiplication (\*): multiplies values on either side of the operator.
  4. Division (/): divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand.
  5. Modulus (%): Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand and returns the remainder.
  6. Increment(++): Increases the value of the operand by 1.
  7. Decrement (--): Decreases the value of operand by 1.
