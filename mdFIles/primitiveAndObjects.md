# Primitive Data Types
These are the predefined data types of Java. 

They specify the size and type of any standard values.

Java has 8 data types:

1. byte: 
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. float
6. double
7. char
8. boolean 

When a variable is copied then another copy of the variable is created and changes made to the copied variable will not reflect changes in the original variable.

# Object Data Type 
a.k.a. Non-primitive or Reference Data Type.

Unlike the primitive these are created by the user. Ex. arrays, strings, classes, interfaces, etc.

In Object Data Type although two copies will be created they both will point to the same variable tin the heap, being so, changes made to any variable will reflect the change in both the variables.
