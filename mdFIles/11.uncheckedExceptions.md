# Exceptions

- Is an event that, while a program is executing, disrupts the flow of a program.
- An exception could occur and cause the program to stop.
- Exceptions are what you throw when some part of your program can no longer fulfill its purpose.
- When an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: Java will throw and excpetion(throw an error).1

## Throwing your own exceptions

- `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException`

```JAVA
    if(condition){
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Some descriptive text");
    }
    if(condition){
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Some other descriptive text");
    }
    return wishedValueWhichWillOnlyReturnIfNoExceptionIsThrown;

```

## Try and catch

- The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
- The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block
- The finally statemtns lets you execute code after the try...catch, regardless of the results

```JAVA
try{
    blockOfCode;
}
catch(exception e){
    blockOfCode;
}
finally{
    blockOfCode;
}
```

## throw keyword

- Allows you to create a custom error
- The throw statements us used together with an exception type.
- THere are many in java: ArithmeticException, FileNotFoundException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, SecurityException, etc.
``` JAVA
public class Main {
  static void checkAge(int age) {
    if (age < 18) {
      throw new ArithmeticException("Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.");
    }
    else {
      System.out.println("Access granted - You are old enough!");
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    checkAge(15); // Set age to 15 (which is below 18...)
  }
}
```
